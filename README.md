# Phasmophobia Category Extensions Hoop AutoSplitter

A autosplitter for scoring hoops. Very dumb yes, but so it running a horror game

this AutoSplitter most likely only works for **Phasmophobia Version 2.0**, I deffinetly will get it working for multipler versions at some point

## How to use

There are 2 ways you can do this.

##### 1) Easy Way

Download the **[hoop.asl](https://github.com/Bangaked/Phasmophobia-Category-Extensions-Hoop-AutoSplitter/blob/main/hoop.asl)** file and put it in your **Components** folder in the **Live Split program folder** `/Split/Components`. Open live split, and hit **Edit Layout**. Then hit the plus, go to **Control**, and click on **Scriptable Auto Splitter**. then double click on the **Scriptable Auto Splitter**, and click on **Browse...** .find the file, and now you can test it out.

##### 2) The Harder way

This is done the same as the easier way, but instead of downloading the file you just copy the code from **[hoop.asl](https://github.com/Bangaked/Phasmophobia-Category-Extensions-Hoop-AutoSplitter/blob/main/hoop.asl)**, create a text doc, paste the code in, and rename it to **(name).ASL**, Make sure you have file name extensions on.

## Disclaimer

This may not work for everyone simply because I can't test if everything works fully. Something that may work for me may not work for you, but if you do find that is doesn't work for you, message me through discord at **Bangaled#4517**

## Extra Info

At least for now, this will be kinda be like a Beta to make sure everything works. Once I have everything working I can make this work for more than just one version. You can always request edits to the code of **[hoop.asl](https://github.com/Bangaked/Phasmophobia-Category-Extensions-Hoop-AutoSplitter/blob/main/hoop.asl)**.
